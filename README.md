# Features List
## Old Features
* As an individual, I want to signup and login to keep my page personal and private who those who don't need to see it.

* As a viewer, I want to be able to see all the tasks created as well as view individual ones.

## New Features
* As a member of a team, I want to be able to make personalized comments so I can ask questions or make things clearer for someone who has a question.

* As a planner who wants to keep track of things to do, I want to create tasks by setting a description and due date and update the status of ones I own so that I can see what I need to do, and how I should prioritize my to do list.  I also want to have a calander to know when a deadline is coming up.

* As an organizer, I want to structure a large task, into many smaller tasks, and also have the ability to set the status of it so I know how much progress I am making in this large task.

* As a leader who has a team, I want to know how progress is going around in the organization as well as assigning them different tasks.
